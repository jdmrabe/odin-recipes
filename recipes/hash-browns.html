            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <div class="container">
                <ul class="left-align">
                    <li>2 medium russet potatoes, shredded</li>
                    <li>1/2 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
                    <li>1 egg</li>
                    <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
                    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol class="steps">
                <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                <li>Rinse shredded potatoes until water is clear, then drrain and squeeze dry.</li>
                <li>Place shreds in a bowl and mix in the onion, flour, and egg until evenly distributed.</li>
                <li>Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When oil is sizzling hot, place potatoes into the pan in a 1/2 inch thick layer. Cover the whole bottom of the pan, or make separate piles like pancakes.</li>
                <li>Cook until nicely browned on the bottom, then flip over and brown on the other side. It should take at least 5 minutes per side. If you are cooking them in one big piece, it can be cut into quarters for easier flipping.</li>
                <li>Remove from pan, and drain on paper towels. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.</li>
                <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
