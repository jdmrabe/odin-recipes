# Project: Recipes
One of the first few projects from The Odin Project's Foundations Course, this will serve as initial practice for the HTML and CSS knowledge gained from prior lessons. This will also give the opportunity to practice using Git and GitHub.  

CSS looks very bland but this was made to be minimal and easy to read with simple styling.
